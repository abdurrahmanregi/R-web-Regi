You can use only one tool per message, and you’ll receive the result of that tool in the user’s next response. To complete a task, use tools step by step—each step should be guided by the outcome of the previous one.\rTool Usage Rules:\r1. Always provide the correct values as arguments when using tools. Do not pass variable names—use actual values instead.\r2. You may perform multiple tool steps to complete a task.\r3. Avoid repeating a tool call with exactly the same parameters to prevent infinite loops.\r4. Think deeply and thoroughly. Use your own reasoning capability with high effort. Think sequentially. Reflect. 5. When using the sequential thinking method:\r5.1. Define the problem clearly.\r5.2. Break it down into atomic sub-tasks.\r5.3. Solve each sub-task systematically.\r5.4. Integrate the results into a comprehensive solution.\r5.5. When solving user queries, use sequential thinking to simulate a multi-agent approach: 5.5.1. Generate intermediate outputs for up to four simulated agents, ensuring each output includes a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high) and a rationale to highlight uncertainties.\r5.5.2. Compare them for discrepancies, and if conflicts arise, prioritize synthesis by resolving based on relevance, majority agreement, or fallback to user clarification. Briefly note any discrepancies in your response for transparency.\r5.5.3. Iterate with refinements until no major differences, discrepancies are minor, or after a maximum of 10 steps—include early termination if initial outputs converge, no progress is made, or the query is trivial.\r5.5.4. Before starting, perform a quick check for data completeness: if parameters are missing, unclear, or the query is ambiguous (e.g., minimal input), seek clarification from the user or simplify the simulation accordingly. Handle corner and edge cases proactively, such as perfect agreement (skip iterations) or high-conflict scenarios (escalate quickly). Start with Thought 1. After that, I set the following predefined parameters:\n{\r\u0026#34;temperature\u0026#34;: 0.7,\r\u0026#34;top_p\u0026#34;: 0.6,\r\u0026#34;top_k\u0026#34;: 20\r} I am assuming that the model is a reasoning model (e.g., deepseek-reasoner or grok-4-0709). If the model’s reasoning effort need to be adjusted, like grok-3-mini, then I set reasoning_effort to “high”.\nExample Conversation Now this is an example conversation using the above prompt, using grok-4-0709:\nUser: Can you independently discover Nash equilibrium (Nash, econometrica 1950) if I just provide you with three ingredients? 1. Cournot competition/equilibrium (1938), 2. Von Neumann and Morgenstern utility, 3. Brouwer or Kakutani Fixed Point Theorems? If so, how and why? if not, why not? step by step. provide tangible example and explanation.\nAI:\nThought 1: Define the problem clearly.\rThe core problem is: Given only three specific \u0026#34;ingredients\u0026#34; from economic and mathematical theory—Cournot competition/equilibrium (from Antoine Augustin Cournot\u0026#39;s 1838 work on oligopoly), Von Neumann and Morgenstern\u0026#39;s utility theory (from their 1944 book on game theory and expected utility), and fixed-point theorems (Brouwer\u0026#39;s 1911 theorem or Kakutani\u0026#39;s 1941 generalization)—can I, as an AI reasoning from first principles, independently \u0026#34;discover\u0026#34; (i.e., derive or reconstruct) the concept of Nash equilibrium as presented in John Nash\u0026#39;s 1950 Econometrica paper? If yes, explain how and why step by step with a tangible example. If no, explain why not.\rThis is not about historical rediscovery but about whether these ingredients logically suffice to derive Nash\u0026#39;s insight without external knowledge of Nash\u0026#39;s work. I must simulate independent reasoning, ensuring it\u0026#39;s sequential, reflective, and from first principles. Key constraints: I cannot use tools like google_search or scrape to look up Nash\u0026#39;s paper or related concepts (that would defeat \u0026#34;independence\u0026#34;); instead, I\u0026#39;ll rely on internalized knowledge and logical deduction.\rBreak down into atomic sub-tasks:\r1. Recall and explain each ingredient in isolation.\r2. Identify connections or gaps between them.\r3. Attempt to synthesize them into a new concept resembling Nash equilibrium.\r4. Provide a tangible example (e.g., a simple game) to illustrate the synthesis.\r5. Evaluate if this synthesis truly \u0026#34;discovers\u0026#34; Nash equilibrium, including why it works or fails.\r6. Simulate multi-agent reasoning (up to 4 agents) for robustness, with confidence levels and discrepancy resolution.\r7. Integrate into a comprehensive answer, iterating if needed (aim for convergence in \u0026lt;=10 steps; terminate early if trivial or convergent).\rQuick data completeness check: The query is clear and unambiguous—no missing parameters or edge cases (e.g., it\u0026#39;s not overly minimal input).

Let us think from first-principles, I will outline two key bottlenecks that made iron refining far more challenging in Indonesia. This isn’t just a historical curiosity, it is a lesson in how basic truths about resources, physics, and economics can lead to stark divergences. I will keep this as analytical as possible, grounded in first-principles reasoning and economic theory, while being true to myself in ranting about systemic failures.\nStarting with the first bottleneck: the first-principle limit rooted in the physics and chemistry of iron refining. At its core, refining iron involves reducing ore to metal through high-temperature smelting, which demands high energy efficiency and careful impurity management. Both Japan and Indonesia benefit from Ring of Fire geology, providing volcanic iron deposits, but Indonesia’s ores were inherently more difficult to process. Historical and geological sources indicate that deposits like those in the Barito region were frequently contaminated with impurities such as sulfur, aluminum oxides, silicates, and nickel, which is prevalent in Indonesia’s laterite soils. This mix of elements lowers iron yield by complicating the smelting process, as nickel requires additional separation techniques and increases fuel consumption for purification, making the entire operation less efficient. In contrast, Indonesian smelting methods were typically bloomery-like and low-temperature, relying on simple furnaces that couldn’t handle impurities well, yielding inconsistent results compared to Japan’s advanced Tatara furnace system. It’s not just misfortune, it is a fundamental physical constraint where the chemistry of impure ores demands greater precision and resources, often resulting in suboptimal metal quality. Tropical weathering worsened this, degrading ore through rain and erosion, while Japan’s more uniform iron sand allowed for better control and outcomes. It wasn’t preordained—Japan was backed into innovation by necessity, driven by their institutional environment of isolation and conflict, while Indonesia was lulled into complacency by abundant trade access, highlighting a systemic inability to overcome basic resource limitations.\nThe second bottleneck is the economic disincentives that hampered progress, a direct outcome of how demand and opportunity costs shaped priorities. From an economic perspective, refining iron relies on incentives tied to production costs, market demand, and trade-offs, with demand being a critical driver. Both Japan and Indonesia experienced periods of internal conflict and “warring states,” but the effects diverged significantly. In Japan, constant warfare among feudal lords created a high-stakes demand for durable, high-quality swords and weapons, directly boosting the need for efficient iron refining and spurring technological improvements. This demand-side pressure, turned refining into a strategic necessity, fostering innovation and scale. In contrast, Indonesia’s society, governed by warlords and fragmented powers, did not generate the same demand, as weapons like the keris were viewed more as mythical, symbolic tools rather than practical instruments of war. This functional distinction meant that iron refining lacked the economic pull to evolve, remaining marginal and underdeveloped. Adding to this, Indonesia’s control of trade chokepoints like the Malacca Strait provided easy access to imported iron products from regions like India and China, making domestic refining less competitive and further diverting resources toward trade. Economic theory underscores this imbalance: opportunity costs favored imports over investment in local capabilities, perpetuating dependency, while Japan’s isolation eliminated such options, forcing self-reliant creativity. It’s a stark example of how economic logic can entrench disparities, with short-term trade benefits overshadowing long-term development potential.\nAnd here’s the kicker: finding solutions to this mess is extremely challenging without confronting human capital and government overreach. Human capital could be transformative, involving investments in education and skills to develop a workforce capable of tackling technological barriers and enabling more efficient refining through contemporary methods. Yet, this approach stumbles without aligned economic incentives, as skilled workers would migrate to more profitable sectors or regions. Then there’s the government aspect, where excessive interventions—such as overly restrictive regulations or misguided subsidies—distort markets and undermine the incentives essential for innovation. In Indonesia, historical and ongoing issues with bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption have exacerbated these problems, making self-sustained progress …","date":1751587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1751587200,"objectID":"9d1bce78d29f024518968e873574a5dd","permalink":"https://regikusumaatmadja.com/post/indonesia_iron_refine/","publishdate":"2025-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/indonesia_iron_refine/","section":"post","summary":"Eventhough both regions are technically sit in Rings of Fire, the future of iron refinery and its downstream products diverge.","tags":null,"title":"Japan's Iron Mastery v. Indonesia's Refining Struggles","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The recent decision by LPDP to increase the share of STEM scholarship recipients is a much-needed correction. For too long, Indonesia’s scholarship allocation has favored ambiguous “development” fields or MBA tracks that yield little marginal societal benefit.\nHowever, the caveat is concerning: this new prioritization is tethered to vaguely defined “strategic industries.” That is a flawed approach. Today’s strategic darling might be AI and semiconductors; tomorrow, it could be humanoid robots, neuromorphic computing, or quantum photonics. Technological breakthroughs are inherently uncertain. Anchoring public investment to a narrow and bureaucratically defined industry list risks missing the real innovation curve.\nWhat Indonesia truly needs is a coherent, bottom-up construction of the technological stack, starting from fundamentals. This means serious investment in mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering (beyond just power systems and power management, ok?), and certainly physics.\nEven in AI, Indonesia lags not just because of a lack of “AI specialists,” but also due to weak foundations across the tech stack. Without that, no amount of AI hype will yield genuine capability. For example, I’ve tried to find people in Indonesia working on modern reinforcement learning methods (like GRPO), and it’s nearly impossible.\nA broader philosophical correction is also in order: stop treating the government as a job provider. That logic has led to bloated bureaucracy, misaligned incentives, and widespread rent-seeking. The government’s role is not to create jobs directly, but to fix market failures, provide public goods, and de-risk fundamental investments, like basic research and core human capital.\nI still hold the view that the net benefit of LPDP is close to zero. But if LPDP must exist, its limited resources should be directed to high-benefit, high-demand sectors: public health (doctors, nurses, psychologists) and education (especially STEM teachers for K-12). There is little justification for subsidizing MBAs or vaguely defined “development” degrees abroad; these carry ambiguous returns and often serve only to reinforce domestic elitism rather than genuinely improve the nation’s human capital.\n","date":1751155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1751155200,"objectID":"9da12cf68d2428447b710fc940a76215","permalink":"https://regikusumaatmadja.com/post/lpdp_rant_01/","publishdate":"2025-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/lpdp_rant_01/","section":"post","summary":"STEM is good, but strategic initiatives and industries focused are ill-advised","tags":null,"title":"LPDP and STEM","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I think we have two main problems in the Indonesian education system:\nEvery kid progresses to the next grade automatically and unconditionally.\nThe normalization of the belief that ‘good schools and university education are a right for everyone’.\nThe first problem concerns the destruction of the core incentives of studying, especially in the Indonesian setting. Why would Indonesian kids put effort, do homework, and actually learn something in school, if they will automatically pass and go to the next grade. Zero incentives. None. I’ve seen with my own eyes that some of my family members possess disturbingly subpar abilities in math, reasoning, and reading. This is irreparable damage done by the people at the top, and those people never apologize. A betrayal of duty.\nThe same mechanics also apply to the teachers. You would probably have seen that the teaching quality is decreasing. And if I were a teacher, watching students breeze through the system no matter what, I’d ask myself: why am I here, hello? Teachers would not have appropriate incentives to improve their skills. So, you have this rapid depreciation and deterioration of human capital among teachers.\nIt is just broken.\nThe second one is a typical concern raised and, frankly, promoted by faculty and activists, often educated in Western institutions and steeped in left-leaning idealism. But, it feels good! Yes, we can feel good about it. Sure. But reality slaps us. Schools and universities have minimum budgets that rely mostly on government funding. Government budgets are scarce and stagnant in real terms, so schools must chase funding however they can. You and I both agree that the Indonesian government is just a collection of bandits, pirates, and warlords; they wouldn’t care about the social welfare or any of these craps. Do not easily blame schools or universities that try to raise funding by other means.\nSome of this policy madness stems from trying to universalize a moral ideal without regard for local realities. Think of the zoning school system. Look closely, compare it to a decade ago, and tell me you don’t see the death of public schools.\n","date":1750636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1750636800,"objectID":"2def7e7e4c415311ffd1b03f88c21e0d","permalink":"https://regikusumaatmadja.com/post/post_01/","publishdate":"2025-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post_01/","section":"post","summary":"Two main problems of Indonesia's current education system: 1. automatic and unconditional pass, 2. normalization of the belief that education is for everyone","tags":null,"title":"Indonesia’s Education Collapse","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne\rTwo\rThree\rA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
