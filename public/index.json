This approach is particularly prominent in econometrics for handling partial identification—where models do not yield a single point estimate but rather a set of possible values consistent with data and assumptions. In industrial organization (IO), moment inequalities are widely used to model strategic interactions (e.g., entry games, auctions) under incomplete information or multiple equilibria, avoiding strong assumptions like unique equilibria or full parametric specifications.\nI’ll structure this as follows:\nOverview of Moment Inequalities: Core concepts and foundational works. Key Seminal Papers: Influential theoretical and methodological contributions. Applications in IO: Papers focusing on empirical IO problems. Recent Developments: From arXiv search (mostly 2024–2025 papers). Inference and Estimation: Key works on statistical methods. Reviews and Handbooks: For deeper dives. Gaps and Notes: Areas for further exploration. This is based on credible sources (e.g., NBER, Econometrica, arXiv). Where possible, I’ve included direct links or arXiv IDs for access. If you’d like me to download/read specific papers (using tools like download_paper or read_paper) or expand on any, let me know.\nOverview of Moment Inequalities Moment inequalities arise in models where economic theory implies bounds (e.g., from optimizing behavior) rather than equalities. For example, in IO, revealed preference might imply that expected profits from an observed action are at least as high as from alternatives, leading to inequalities like ( E[\\Delta \\pi] \\geq 0 ). These models often result in partial identification: the data and assumptions identify a set (Θ_I) rather than a single point. This is common in games with multiple equilibria or unobserved heterogeneity.\nFoundational motivation: Moment inequalities allow credible assumptions (e.g., weak rationality) while avoiding implausible ones (e.g., unique equilibria or perfect foresight). They are reviewed in Tamer (2010) and Ho and Rosen (2017).\nKey Seminal Papers These papers established the framework and inference methods:\nPakes (2010): “Alternative Models for Moment Inequalities” (Econometrica). Introduces inequalities from revealed preference in dynamic and strategic settings. Key for IO applications like entry and investment.

Here’s a comprehensive explanation of this concept, including its definition, mathematical foundations, practical insights, and limitations.\nWhat is Nash Equilibrium and How Does It Relate to Fixed Points? Nash equilibrium is a fundamental concept in game theory, representing a strategy profile where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming all other players’ strategies remain unchanged. This stability can be mathematically interpreted as a fixed point, where a fixed point is a value that remains unchanged under a specific function or mapping. In this case, the relevant mapping is the best-response function, which assigns to each strategy profile the strategies that maximize each player’s payoff given the others’ strategies. A Nash equilibrium occurs when this mapping results in the same strategy profile, meaning no player has an incentive to deviate.\nMathematical Foundations The connection between Nash equilibrium and fixed points is rigorously established through fixed-point theorems. For instance, John Nash’s original proof used Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem to show that equilibria exist in finite games with continuous strategy spaces, while Kakutani’s fixed-point theorem extends this to more general cases, such as games involving mixed strategies or set-valued mappings. This framework ensures that under conditions like compact and convex strategy spaces, a Nash equilibrium exists as a fixed point, providing a stable “resting point” in strategic interactions.\nWhy This Perspective is Useful Viewing Nash equilibrium as a fixed point offers powerful analytical tools. It facilitates proofs of equilibrium existence in various game types, including symmetric and asymmetric games, and connects game theory to fields like optimization and dynamical systems. For example, in evolutionary game theory, fixed points can model long-term behavioral stability, while in pure-strategy games, they simplify interpretation. This analogy highlights strategic stability, where the equilibrium acts like a point of no change, much like in other mathematical contexts.\nNuances and Limitations While the fixed-point interpretation is standard, it has limitations in certain scenarios. In games with discontinuous payoffs or non-convex strategy spaces, fixed-point theorems may not apply, potentially leading to non-existence of equilibria or requiring alternative approaches. Computational challenges arise, as finding Nash equilibria can be NP-hard, especially in large or infinite-strategy games, where methods like iterative best-response may not converge efficiently. Additionally, in mixed-strategy equilibria, the mapping involves probability distributions, adding complexity.\nAlternative perspectives, such as those in quantum game theory, suggest that Nash equilibria may not always align with fixed points due to non-classical correlations, leading to concepts like quantum Nash equilibria. Behavioral critiques also note that assumptions of perfect rationality may not hold in real-world settings, prompting alternatives like quantal response equilibria or evolutionary stable strategies, which better capture dynamics like learning or bounded rationality. Not all fixed points are Nash equilibria, as some may lack the strategic stability required.\nIn summary, Nash equilibrium is fundamentally linked to fixed points through mathematical game theory, offering a robust framework for analysis while acknowledging contexts where refinements or different approaches may be necessary. This perspective underscores its role as a cornerstone of strategic stability, supported by established theory and …","date":1752969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752969600,"objectID":"f690157ec2e1a35b06a0b40f9b2d6a4d","permalink":"https://regikusumaatmadja.com/post/grok-3-mini-high-heavy/","publishdate":"2025-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/grok-3-mini-high-heavy/","section":"post","summary":"Simulating Grok 3 mini with 4 agents for a 'Heavy' mode experience.

Let us think from first-principles, I will outline two key bottlenecks that made iron refining far more challenging in Indonesia. This isn’t just a historical curiosity, it is a lesson in how basic truths about resources, physics, and economics can lead to stark divergences. I will keep this as analytical as possible, grounded in first-principles reasoning and economic theory, while being true to myself in ranting about systemic failures.\nStarting with the first bottleneck: the first-principle limit rooted in the physics and chemistry of iron refining. At its core, refining iron involves reducing ore to metal through high-temperature smelting, which demands high energy efficiency and careful impurity management. Both Japan and Indonesia benefit from Ring of Fire geology, providing volcanic iron deposits, but Indonesia’s ores were inherently more difficult to process. Historical and geological sources indicate that deposits like those in the Barito region were frequently contaminated with impurities such as sulfur, aluminum oxides, silicates, and nickel, which is prevalent in Indonesia’s laterite soils. This mix of elements lowers iron yield by complicating the smelting process, as nickel requires additional separation techniques and increases fuel consumption for purification, making the entire operation less efficient. In contrast, Indonesian smelting methods were typically bloomery-like and low-temperature, relying on simple furnaces that couldn’t handle impurities well, yielding inconsistent results compared to Japan’s advanced Tatara furnace system. It’s not just misfortune, it is a fundamental physical constraint where the chemistry of impure ores demands greater precision and resources, often resulting in suboptimal metal quality. Tropical weathering worsened this, degrading ore through rain and erosion, while Japan’s more uniform iron sand allowed for better control and outcomes. It wasn’t preordained—Japan was backed into innovation by necessity, driven by their institutional environment of isolation and conflict, while Indonesia was lulled into complacency by abundant trade access, highlighting a systemic inability to overcome basic resource limitations.\nThe second bottleneck is the economic disincentives that hampered progress, a direct outcome of how demand and opportunity costs shaped priorities. From an economic perspective, refining iron relies on incentives tied to production costs, market demand, and trade-offs, with demand being a critical driver. Both Japan and Indonesia experienced periods of internal conflict and “warring states,” but the effects diverged significantly. In Japan, constant warfare among feudal lords created a high-stakes demand for durable, high-quality swords and weapons, directly boosting the need for efficient iron refining and spurring technological improvements. This demand-side pressure, turned refining into a strategic necessity, fostering innovation and scale. In contrast, Indonesia’s society, governed by warlords and fragmented powers, did not generate the same demand, as weapons like the keris were viewed more as mythical, symbolic tools rather than practical instruments of war. This functional distinction meant that iron refining lacked the economic pull to evolve, remaining marginal and underdeveloped. Adding to this, Indonesia’s control of trade chokepoints like the Malacca Strait provided easy access to imported iron products from regions like India and China, making domestic refining less competitive and further diverting resources toward trade. Economic theory underscores this imbalance: opportunity costs favored imports over investment in local capabilities, perpetuating dependency, while Japan’s isolation eliminated such options, forcing self-reliant creativity. It’s a stark example of how economic logic can entrench disparities, with short-term trade benefits overshadowing long-term development potential.\nAnd here’s the kicker: finding solutions to this mess is extremely challenging without confronting human capital and government overreach. Human capital could be transformative, involving investments in education and skills to develop a workforce capable of tackling technological barriers and enabling more efficient refining through contemporary methods. Yet, this approach stumbles without aligned economic incentives, as skilled workers would migrate to more profitable sectors or regions. Then there’s the government aspect, where excessive interventions—such as overly restrictive regulations or misguided subsidies—distort markets and undermine the incentives essential for innovation. In Indonesia, historical and ongoing issues with bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption have exacerbated these problems, making self-sustained progress …","date":1751587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1751587200,"objectID":"9d1bce78d29f024518968e873574a5dd","permalink":"https://regikusumaatmadja.com/post/indonesia_iron_refine/","publishdate":"2025-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/indonesia_iron_refine/","section":"post","summary":"Eventhough both regions are technically sit in Rings of Fire, the future of iron refinery and its downstream products diverge.","tags":null,"title":"Japan's Iron Mastery v.

For too long, Indonesia’s scholarship allocation has favored ambiguous “development” fields or MBA tracks that yield little marginal societal benefit.\nHowever, the caveat is concerning: this new prioritization is tethered to vaguely defined “strategic industries.” That is a flawed approach. Today’s strategic darling might be AI and semiconductors; tomorrow, it could be humanoid robots, neuromorphic computing, or quantum photonics. Technological breakthroughs are inherently uncertain. Anchoring public investment to a narrow and bureaucratically defined industry list risks missing the real innovation curve.\nWhat Indonesia truly needs is a coherent, bottom-up construction of the technological stack, starting from fundamentals. This means serious investment in mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering (beyond just power systems and power management, ok?), and certainly physics.\nEven in AI, Indonesia lags not just because of a lack of “AI specialists,” but also due to weak foundations across the tech stack. Without that, no amount of AI hype will yield genuine capability. For example, I’ve tried to find people in Indonesia working on modern reinforcement learning methods (like GRPO), and it’s nearly impossible.\nA broader philosophical correction is also in order: stop treating the government as a job provider. That logic has led to bloated bureaucracy, misaligned incentives, and widespread rent-seeking. The government’s role is not to create jobs directly, but to fix market failures, provide public goods, and de-risk fundamental investments, like basic research and core human capital.\nI still hold the view that the net benefit of LPDP is close to zero. But if LPDP must exist, its limited resources should be directed to high-benefit, high-demand sectors: public health (doctors, nurses, psychologists) and education (especially STEM teachers for K-12).

Why would Indonesian kids put effort, do homework, and actually learn something in school, if they will automatically pass and go to the next grade. Zero incentives. None. I’ve seen with my own eyes that some of my family members possess disturbingly subpar abilities in math, reasoning, and reading. This is irreparable damage done by the people at the top, and those people never apologize. A betrayal of duty.\nThe same mechanics also apply to the teachers. You would probably have seen that the teaching quality is decreasing. And if I were a teacher, watching students breeze through the system no matter what, I’d ask myself: why am I here, hello? Teachers would not have appropriate incentives to improve their skills. So, you have this rapid depreciation and deterioration of human capital among teachers.\nIt is just broken.\nThe second one is a typical concern raised and, frankly, promoted by faculty and activists, often educated in Western institutions and steeped in left-leaning idealism. But, it feels good! Yes, we can feel good about it. Sure. But reality slaps us. Schools and universities have minimum budgets that rely mostly on government funding.

They often express their views but, in my opinion, lack the ability to provide innovative and significant solutions to the problems they address, despite their fervent attempts.\nThis class is typically found on social media, in universities, within the government, and also among certain segments of private and state-owned enterprises. They are often graduates of Indonesia’s top three universities, who then pursue their postgraduate studies in foreign countries, their studies financed by the unwitting Indonesian taxpayers through ‘prestigious’ government scholarships.\nMy first encounter with individuals from this class dates back to my high school and undergraduate years, about a decade ago. There were senior students who attempted to convince us, the freshmen, that “we are the future leaders of Indonesia,” and “we should consider policies that influence the direction of Indonesia,” among other statements. Another interesting instance involves certain companies that employ a large group of policy professionals whose primary role is to communicate with the government and shape policies. Why not simply focus on profitability without relying on government subsidies? This remains a puzzle. To be clear, I once embraced these perspectives and was actually part of this class. Talk about irony!\nI personally believe that the reason this class is so talkative (hence the name \u0026#34;Garrulous Class\u0026#34;) is a sense of inadequacy stemming from their lack of technical skills to directly address and solve the issues they raise. The highly educated individuals in this class recognize that they may be overeducated in somewhat impractical fields, lacking necessary technical competencies.\nMy concern is that this class will continue to grow while technical experts – those pushing the boundaries of knowledge, economy, and society – are leaving for other countries. Consider the number of Indonesian STEM graduates becoming Singaporean citizens, or the number of Indonesian physicists and material scientists who manage to secure funding from the Korean Department of Defense, among other similar cases.\nDo I have a solution to this perceived oversupply? No, I don’t. But I do acknowledge my own bias and disdain for this class. It’s possible that I am mistaken.
