I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at VU Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute, the Netherlands. My main research interests include Industrial Organization, Applied Econometrics, and the Economics of Innovation. 

Besides my academic life, I have previously done some research and consultancy for private and public entities. In addition, I enjoy playing tennis (still a newb!).
