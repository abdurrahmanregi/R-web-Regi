I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at <a href="https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/school-of-business-and-economics/departments/economics" target="_blank">VU Amsterdam</a> and <a href="https://tinbergen.nl/home" target="_blank">Tinbergen Institute</a>, the Netherlands. My supervisors are <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/sabien-dobbelaere" target="_blank">Sabien Dobbelaere</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/joseluismoraga/" target="_blank">Jose Luis Moraga-Gonzalez</a>. My main research interests include Industrial Organization, Applied Econometrics, and the Economics of Innovation.  I am currently visiting the Department of Economics at the Pennsylvania State University under the invitation of <a href="http://personal.psu.edu/m7r/" target="_blank">Mark J. Roberts</a>.

I am currently trying to understand why firms decide to perform in-house R&D or outsource it to other entities. Another thing I am pondering now is what happens to the firm's direction of innovation, given certain changes in the market structure.

Besides my academic life, I have previously done some research and consultancy for private and public entities. In addition, I enjoy playing tennis (still a newb!).
