abstract: This paper analyzes the costs and benefits of internal and external R&D activities. Using Dutch production and innovation surveys between 2000 and 2020, I document an increasing trend of internal  R&D in the Dutch IT industry, but not for external R&D, and present suggestive evidence that both internal and external R&D are complementary. To rationalize these findings, I build and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of R&D, which includes specific investment costs of internal and external R&D. I find that the cost of doing external R&D is significantly much higher than the internal R&D, reflecting the transaction costs of such contract and explaining the observed small share of external-only R&D firms in the data. From the estimates of the model, I also find that the complementarity of these two R&D activities can be attributed to two sources; the cost and revenue sides. Finally, I provide some simulations of R&D subsidization programs that mimic the Innovation Box policy implemented by the Dutch government.

summary: Here I am trying to understand why firms perform of in-house R&D (internal R&D) and/or contract out their R&D to other strategic entities (external R&D)
